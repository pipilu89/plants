    <title>Apocynaceae Family</title>
    
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>The Apocynaceae family is a group of flowering plants commonly known as the Dogbanes, Periwinkles or Oleanders. They are characterized by having milky sap (latex) which gives them a degree of resistance to pests and diseases. This family includes trees, shrubs, vines, stem succulents, root parasites, and one genus of herbs. Members of this family can be recognized by having simple, opposite, entire leaves and small, basic flowers borne in leaf axils or clusters. Most often, these flowers do not open fully to attract pollinators such as moths, bats, hummingbirds, sunbirds, monkeys etc. Apocynaceae generally have deep orange or red colors due to presence of flavonoids.</p>

Some genera of this family include Allamanda, Aphanostephus, Asclepias, Ceropegia, Funtumia, Gloriosa, Hoya, Mandevilla, Marsdenia, Nerium, Ochrosia, Pachypodanthium, Rauvolfia, Strophanthus, Tabernaemontana among many others. These plants serve various purposes, including sources of medicine, dyes, food, wood, fibre, oil, latex, gums and rubber. Many members of this family are cultivated as ornamentals. Despite containing several poisonous species, it has been reported that certain ethnic groups use some Apocynaceous plants as famine food during periods of drought or scarcity.</p>
