        <p>The Rhizophoraceae family of plants includes the mangroves. These plants have the following characteristics:
        </p>

        <ul>
            The leaves often have a network of veins, called "araoid" type venation. Sometimes, the veins run parallel
            instead of interconnecting.</ul>
        <ul>
            Many of the genera have broad, paddle-shaped leaves.</ul>
        <ul>
            The flowers have only three fused stamens, arranged together in a structure called a "synandrium." There
            might be smaller extra petals, called "staminodia," nearby. When the flower opens, it reveals either pollen
            or carpels containing one seed each.</ul>
        <ul>
            The petals are attached to four or five connected ("connate") outer parts of the bud called "sepals". An
            opening at the top of the calyx is covered by a loosely fitting cap, called an "operculum." It often has
            hairs inside and wraps around the inner part of the flower as if squeezing down onto the ovary. When the
            fruit ripens, it splits apart horizontally between the receptacle supporting the fruit and the ovary inside.
        </ul>
        <ul>
            The fruit produced is dry, does not burst open naturally upon ripening (called "indehiscent"), with most of
            the body composed of a single seed developing out of one flower and another small fruitlet splitting away
            from it which had been borne by a different flower next to it, but with the attachment point separating
            cleanly so only a thin membrane connects them through their lifecycle, leaving behind only the outer whorl
            of fruitlets surrounding the core set of fertile seed pods in a cluster with up to a hundred total species
            altogether. Notably, the fruit is never a real "berry" because there is only ever one seed that grows large
            enough to consume any space inside the fruit; in contrast, berries will have lots of tiny seeds formed from
            ovules on one central column or placenta rather than on separate ovules borne on separate scaly plates
            ("carpellaries"). Furthermore, this particular family is unusual amongst flowering plants for having male
            anthers divided into bundles instead of occurring singly or in pairs atop a filament before being held
            within a cup. The male gametes do indeed take advantage of wind dispersal since some winds blow directly
            from Africa to the Americas in some seasons.</ul>
        <ul>
            Overall, there are about a hundred main species with maybe twice that count if you account for uncertainties
            involving disputed classification in this scientific grouping system for organizing plants based on their
            shared evolutionary history. Most of the mangrove species grow in freshwater swamps around ocean estuaries,
            occasionally infiltrated with saltwaters especially when sea levels rise temporarily or permanently due to
            geological changes over millions of years; only a handful persist ashore further inland like nonvascular
            bryophytes. They form dense populations creating new trees and shrubs by sprouting roots and then shoots
            upward from horizontal root nodes ("rhizophores") that stand higher off the ground just slightly beneath the
            surface of the soft muddy earth, making sure the shoot avoids drowning once standing upright as it continues
            growing into a tree. Mangroves can store carbon dioxide gas absorbed from the air into their deep
            underground systems of thick, woody prop roots buried vertically and angled back toward deeper layers of
            mud, protecting against tidal erosion or natural subsidence common in delta environments dominated by weak
            clays. Even when partially submerged, the mangroves still maintain strong cell walls that prevent
            waterlogging and keep the wood rigid and durable, allowing them to continue functioning properly.</ul>
