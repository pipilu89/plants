Plumeria alba is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae (also known as the dogbane or periwinkle family). It is native to the Pacific Islands, Mexico and Central America, and can be found from sea level up to an altitude of 1200 meters.

This tree-like shrubby plant typically grows between 2 -6 meters tall with its branches spreading out horizontally. The leaves are dark green in color, oval shaped, glossy and 7-15 cm long. The flowers of this plant are 8â€“9 cm diameter, white in color with yellow at center, very fragrant resembling jasmine and bloom singly or clustered at the end of each branch.

Common names of Plumeria alba include Frangipani, Temple Tree, Jasmine Flower, Pagoda Tree or Cradle Tree depending on the region they are located. They all come from the observation made by colonizers who came across Asia where the flower was commonly used in religious ceremonies for Buddhists temples called frangipani in Hinduism and the belief of purity associated with them by carrying babies in cradles suspended on them during travel time. These trees play significant role in Asian culture with variety of spiritual and medicinal purposes besides their use in making leis, soap, candle, incense sticks, hair tonics and soaps etc.

The fruits that grow on plumeria alba L are brownish capsules which contain several seeds each. This flower can be grown as ornamental plants and also for their essential oil extracts used widely in perfumery and cosmetics industries because of their sweet scent reminiscent of fresh citrus flowers.
It's considered invasive species in some parts of the world like Hawaii due to displacing native flora and fauna of local ecosystems as well as its ability to self propagate through roots and seeds.
